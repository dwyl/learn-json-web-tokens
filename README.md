## *Why*?

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) make it *easy* to _**send read-only signed**_ "_**claims**_"
between services (*both internal and external to your app/site*).
Claims are *any* bits of data that you want someone else to be able to *read*
and/or *verify* but ***not alter***.


> **Note**: *If that sounds buzz-wordy, don't worry, it will all become clear in the next 5 mins of reading!*

## What?

> "***JSON Web Token*** *(JWT) is a compact* ***URL-safe*** *means of
> representing claims to be transferred between two parties.
> The claims in a JWT are* ***encoded*** *as a* ***JSON object*** *that is* ***digitally
> signed*** *using JSON Web Signature (JWS)*.  ~ IETF

###  In *English*

To identify/authenticate people in your (web/mobile) app,
put a ***standards-based token*** in the **header** or **url** of the page
(or API endpoint) which proves the user has logged in and is allowed to
access the desired content.

example: `https://www.yoursite.com/private-content/?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1Qi.eyJrZXkiOi.eUiabuiKv`

> **Note**: if this does not *look* "secure" to you,
scroll down to the "[***security***](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-json-web-tokens#q-if-i-put-the-jwt-in-the-url-or-header-is-it-secure)" section.

### What does a JWT *Look* Like?

Tokens are a string of "url safe" characters which *encode* information.
Tokens have **three components** (separated by periods)
(shown here on multiple lines for *readability* but used as a single string of text)

```
eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9           // header
.eyJrZXkiOiJ2YWwiLCJpYXQiOjE0MjI2MDU0NDV9      // payload
.eUiabuiKv-8PYk2AkGY4Fb5KMZeorYBLw261JPQD5lM   // signature
```

#### 1. Header

The first part of a JWT is an encoded string representation
of a simple JavaScript object which describes the token along with the hashing algorithm used.

#### 2. Payload

The second part of the JWT forms the core of the token.
Payload length is proportional to the amount of data you store in the JWT.
General rule of thumb is: store the bare minimum in the JWT.


#### 3. Signature

The third, and final, part of the JWT is a signature generated
based on the header (part one) and the body (part two) and will be used
to *verify* that the JWT is valid.

### What are "Claims"?

Claims are the predefined **keys** and their **values**:

+ **iss**: issuer of the token
+ **exp**: the expiration timestamp (reject tokens which have expired). Note: as defined in the spec, this must be in seconds.
+ **iat**: The time the JWT was issued. Can be used to determine the age of the JWT
+ **jti**: unique identifier for the JWT. Used to prevent the JWT from being re-used or replayed.
+ **nbf**: "not before" is a future time when the token will become active. (optional)
+ **sub**: subject of the token (rarely used)
+ **aud**: audience of the token (also rarely used)

See: https://self-issued.info/docs/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token.html#RegisteredClaimName

# Example [![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-json-web-tokens/issues)

Lets get stuck in with a simple example.
(the *full* source is in the **/example** directory)

> TRY it: https://jwt.herokuapp.com/

To play around with the example you can open it in Gitpod (requires OAuth with GitHub).

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/dwyl/learn-json-web-tokens/blob/master/example/lib/helpers.js)

## Server

Using the *core* **node.js http** server we create 4 endpoints in **/example/server.js**:

1. **/home** : home page (not essential but its where our **login** form is.)
2. **/auth** : *authenticate* the visitor (returns error + login form if failed)
3. **/private** : our restricted content - ***login required*** (valid session token) to see this page
4. **/logout** : invalidates the token and logs out the user (prevent from re-using old token)

We have *deliberately* made **server.js** as _simple as possible_ for:

+ Readability
+ Maintainability
+ Testability (all helper/handler methods are tested separately)

> note: if you can make it _simpler_, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-json-web-tokens/issues) to discuss!

## Helper Methods

All the helper methods are kept in **/example/lib/helpers.js**
The two most interesting/relevant methods are (simplified versions shown here):

```javascript
// generate the JWT
function generateToken(req){
  return jwt.sign({
    auth:  'magic',
    agent: req.headers['user-agent'],
    exp:   Math.floor(new Date().getTime()/1000) + 7*24*60*60; // Note: in seconds!
  }, secret);  // secret is defined in the environment variable JWT_SECRET
}
```
Which ***generates*** our JWT token when the user authenticates (this is then sent back to the client in the **Authorization** header for use in subsequent requests),

and

```javascript
// validate the token supplied in request header
function validate(req, res) {
  var token = req.headers.authorization;
  try {
    var decoded = jwt.verify(token, secret);
  } catch (e) {
    return authFail(res);
  }
  if(!decoded || decoded.auth !== 'magic') {
    return authFail(res);
  } else {
    return privado(res, token);
  }
}
```

Which **checks the JWT supplied by the client is valid**,
shows private ("privado") content to the requestor if valid
and renders the **authFail** ***error*** page if its not.

**Note**: *Yes*, *both* these methods are ***synchronous***.
But, given that neither of these methods require *any* **I/O** *or* **Network** requests,
its pretty safe to compute them synchronously.

## Frequently Asked Questions (*FAQ*)

> ***Got a Question? Ask!*** >> https://github.com/dwyl/learn-json-web-tokens/issues


### Q: If I put the JWT in the *URL* or *Header* is it *secure*?

Good question! The *quick* **answer** is: ***No***.
Unless you are using SSL/TLS (http**s** in your url) to encrypt the connection,
sending the Token [***in-the-clear***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintext)
is *always* going to be insecure (the token can be intercepted and re-used by a bad person...).
A *naive* "*mitigation*" is to add *verifiable* "claims" to the token
such as checking that the request came from the ***same browser*** (user-agent),
**IP address** or more advanced
"[**browser fingerprints**](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3287761/1148249)"
... https://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/122385

The solution is to *either*:
+ use one-time-use (_single use_) tokens (_which expire after the link has been clicked_) ***or***
+ Don't use url-tokens where high degree of security is required.
(e.g: don't send someone a link which allows them to perform a transaction)

**Use-cases** for a JWT token in a url are:
+ account verification - when you email a person a link after they register on your site. `https://yoursite.co/account/verify?token=jwt.goes.here`
+ password re-set - ensures that the person re-setting the password has access to the email belonging to the account.
 `https://yoursite.co/account/reset-password?token=jwt.goes.here`

Both of these are good candidates for single-use tokens (_which expire after they have been clicked_).

### Q: How do we *Invalidate* sessions?

The person using your app has their **device** (phone/tablet/laptop)
***stolen***. How do you invalidate the token they were using?

The idea behind JWT is that the tokens are ***stateless***
they can be **computed** by any node in a cluster and verified
without a (slow) request to a database.

#### Store the Token in a Database?

##### LevelDB

If your app is *small* or you don't want to have to run a Redis server,
you can get most of the benefits of Redis by using LevelDB: http://leveldb.org/

We can ***either*** store the ***valid*** Tokens in the DB **or**
we can store the ***invalid*** tokens.
Both of these require a round-trip to the DB to check if valid/invalid.
So we prefer to store ***all*** tokens and update the
**valid** property of the token from true to false.

Example record stored in LevelDB
```json
"GUID" : {
  "auth" : "true",
  "created" : "timestamp",
  "uid" : "1234"
}
```
We would lookup this record by its GUID:

```js
var db = require('level');
db.get(GUID, function(err, record){
  // pseudo-code
  if(record.auth){
    // display private content
  } else {
    // show error message
  }
});
```
see: example/lib/helpers.js **validate** method for detail.

##### Redis

Redis is the *scalable* way of storing your tokens.

#### Memcache?

***Quick* answer**: *use **Redis***:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10558465/memcache-vs-redis


### Q: Returning Visitor (*no State Preservation between sessions*)

Cookies are stored on the client and are sent by the browser to the server on every request. If the person *closes* their browser, cookies are preserved, so they can continue where they left off without having to log-in again. However, cookies will be sent on **all** requests that match the path and issuing domain, including those for images and css, where it isn't needed.

[`localStorage`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.localStorage) provides a better mechanism for storing tokens during and between browser sessions.

#### Browser-based Applications

There are two options for storing your JWTs:
1. Use ***localStorage*** to store your JWTs on the client side (_means you need to remember to send the JWT in your `authorization` header for subsequent http/ajax requests_)
2. Store your JWT in a cookie (_set and forget_)

> We _obviously_ prefer the cookie-less approach.
But if done right, cookies still have their place in modern web apps!
(_see the Auth0 article on "10 things you should know" in the further reading below_)

(**Quick answer**: ***Yes***! IE 8 & above, Android 4.0+, IOS 7.1+, Chrome & Firefox )


#### Programmatic (API) Access

Other services accessing your API will have to store the token in a
retrieval system (e.g: Redis or SQLite for mobile apps) and send the token back on each request.

### How to generate secret key?

> "*Apologies if this is mentioned elsewhere. The private key used for signing the tokens, is this the same as a private key generated using ssh-keygen?*" ~ Originally asked by [@skota](https://github.com/skota) see: [dwyl/**hapi-auth-jwt2/issues**/48](https://github.com/dwyl/hapi-auth-jwt2/issues/48)


Since JSON Web Tokens (JWT) do not have to be signed using [***asymmetric encryption***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) you do not *have* to generate your secret key using ***ssh-keygen***. You can just as easily use a ***strong password*** e.g: https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm provided it's ***long and random***. The chance of collision (and thus someone being able to modify the payload, adding or modifying claims, and create a valid signature) is pretty low. And if you join two of those **Strong Passwords** (*strings*) together, you'll have a 128bit ASCII String. So the chances of collision are less than the [number of *atoms* in the universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe#Matter_content_.E2.80.94_number_of_atoms).

To quickly and easily create a secret key using Node's crypto library, run this command.

    node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'));"

In other words, you *can* use an ***RSA key***, but you don't *have to*.

The main thing you need to remember is: don't share the key with people who are not in your core ("*DevOps Team*") or *accidentally* publish it by committing it to GitHub!
